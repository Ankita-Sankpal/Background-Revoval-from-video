#Robust Video Matting (RVM) Background Removal
Background-Revoval-from-video
Background Revoval from video using RVM model 
A high-quality video background removal implementation using RVM (Robust Video Matting) in PyTorch. This project provides a complete Google Colab notebook for professional-grade video matting with temporal consistency.

Features
üé≠ High-Quality Matting: Produces clean alpha mattes with excellent edge details

‚ö° GPU Acceleration: Optimized for CUDA-enabled GPUs (works on CPU too)

üé• Temporal Consistency: Maintains frame-to-frame coherence for smooth video results

üñåÔ∏è Flexible Backgrounds: Supports custom background colors or images

üìä Progress Tracking: Real-time frame processing updates
